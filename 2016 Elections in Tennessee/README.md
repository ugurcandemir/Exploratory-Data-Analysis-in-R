# 2016 Elections in Tennessee

I wanted to analyze 2016 elections. Picked a random state , Tennessee , and
ran a quick analysis on the basis of county. In summary Trump won 92 of the 95
counties. But Clinton wallopingly won two densely populated counties, Shelby and Davidson ,  which are home to Memphis and Nashville.
